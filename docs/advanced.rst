Management commands
-------------------

Since all management commands occur outside the request/response cycle, all
commands from Django and any other third party apps are executed by default on
the public schema. In order to work around this, we provide a ``runschema``
command that accepts any other command to be run on one or multiple schemas. A
concise synopsis of the ``runschema`` command is as follows::

    usage: manage.py runschema [--noinput] [-s SCHEMAS [SCHEMAS ...]]
                           [-as] [-ss] [-ds] [-ts]
                           [--executor {sequential,parallel}]
                           [--no-create-schemas]
                           command_name

    Wrapper around django commands for use with an individual schema

    positional arguments:
    command_name          The command name you want to run

    optional arguments:
    --noinput, --no-input
                            Tells Django to NOT prompt the user for input of any
                            kind.
    -s SCHEMAS [SCHEMAS ...], --schema SCHEMAS [SCHEMAS ...]
                            Schema(s) to execute the current command
    -as, --include-all-schemas
                            Include all schemas when executing the current command
    -ss, --include-static-schemas
                            Include all static schemas when executing the current
                            command
    -ds, --include-dynamic-schemas
                            Include all dynamic schemas when executing the current
                            command
    -ts, --include-tenant-schemas
                            Include all tenant-like schemas when executing the
                            current command
    --executor {sequential,parallel}
                            Executor to be used for running command on schemas
    --no-create-schemas   Skip automatic creation of non-existing schemas

The ``--schema`` parameter accepts multiple inputs of different kinds:

- The key of a static tenant or the ``schema_name`` of a dynamic tenant.
- The prefix of any domain, provided only one corresponding tenant is found.
- The ``domain/folder`` of a tenant, like ``customers.mydomain.com/client1``

The parameters ``-as``, ``-ss``, ``-ds`` and ``-ts`` act as wildcards for
including all schemas, static schemas, dynamic schemas and tenant-like schemas,
respectively. Tenant-like schemas are dynamic schemas plus the clone reference,
if it exists.

At least one schema is mandatory. If it's not provided with the command, either
explicitly or via wildcard params, it will be asked interactively. One notable
exception to this is when the option ``--noinput`` is passed, in which case the
command will fail.

The executor argument accepts two options:

:sequential:
    Will run the command synchronously, one schema at a time. This is the
    default executor.

:parallel:
    Will run the command asynchronously, spawning multiple threads controlled
    by the setting ``PGSCHEMAS_PARALLEL_MAX_PROCESSES``. It defaults to
    ``None``, in which case the number of CPUs will be used.

By default, schemas that do not exist will be created (but not synchronized),
except if ``--no-create-schemas`` is passed.

Inheritable commands
++++++++++++++++++++

We also provide some base commands you can inherit, in order to mimic the
behavior of ``runschema``. By inheriting these you will get the parameters
we discussed in the previous section. The base commands provide a
``handle_tenant`` you must override in order to execute the actions you need
on any given tenant.

The base commands are:

.. code-block:: python

    # django_pgschemas.management.commands.__init__.py

    class TenantCommand(WrappedSchemaOption, BaseCommand):
        # ...

        def handle_tenant(self, tenant, *args, **options):
            pass

    class StaticTenantCommand(TenantCommand):
        # ...

    class DynamicTenantCommand(TenantCommand):
        # ...

.. attention::

    Since these commands can work with both static and dynamic tenants, the
    parameter ``tenant`` could be an instance of
    ``settings.TENANTS["public"]["TENANT_MODEL"]`` or
    ``django_pgschemas.schema.SchemaDescriptor``. Make sure you do the
    appropriate type checking before accessing the tenant members.

Caching
-------

In order to generate tenant aware cache keys, you can use
``django_pgschemas.cache.make_key`` as your ``KEY_FUNCTION``:

.. code-block:: python

    CACHES = {
        "default": {
            # ...
            "KEY_FUNCTION": "django_pgschemas.cache.make_key",
        }
    }

Channels (websockets)
---------------------

We provide a tenant aware protocol router for using with ``channels``. You can
use it as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    # routing.py

    from django_pgschemas.contrib.channels import TenantProtocolRouter

    application = TenantProtocolRouter()

    # settings.py

    ASGI_APPLICATION = "routing.application"

It requires that you also route the websockets requests, at least for the
dynamic tenants. If you don't route websocket requests for static tenants, the
dynamic route will be used:

.. code-block:: python

    TENANTS = {
        # ...
        "default": {
            # ...
            "URLCONF": "tenant_app.urls",
            "WS_URLCONF": "tenant_app.ws_urls",
        }
    }

You still need to name your channel groups appropriately, taking the
current tenant into account if you want to keep your groups tenant-specific.
You will get the current tenant in ``scope["tenant"]``.

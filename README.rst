This app uses PostgreSQL schemas to support data multi-tenancy in a single
Django project. It is a fork of `django-tenants`_ with some conceptual changes:

- There are static tenants and dynamic tenants. Static tenants can have their
  own apps and urlconf.
- Tenants are routed both via subdomain and via subfolder on shared subdomain.
- Public is no longer the schema for storing the main site data. Public should
  be used only for true shared data across all tenants. Table "overriding" via
  search path is no longer encouraged.
- Management commands can be run on multiple schemas via wildcards - the
  multiproc behavior of migrations was extended to just any tenant command.

.. attention::

    We are currently looking for people to test the subfolder routing in their
    current multi-tenant projects. We have reports of third party apps not
    working properly with ``django-pgschemas`` when using subfolder routing.
    We need *your* help to reproduce, disect and fix the errors. Thanks!
